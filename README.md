# Root-Me Forensics Challenge: Deleted File

---

## Overview/Description
The challenge involves recovering a deleted or hidden file from a USB disk image and extracting the hidden ownerâ€™s name formatted as `firstname_lastname`.

Your cousin found a USB drive in the library this morning. Heâ€™s not very good with computers, so heâ€™s hoping you can find the owner of this stick!

The flag is the ownerâ€™s identity in the form firstname_lastname.

---

## Challenge Description

- A compressed archive containing a USB disk image was provided.
- The disk image contains a FAT32 filesystem.
- A file has been deleted or hidden inside this image.
- The task is to recover the deleted file and extract the flag (the ownerâ€™s name).

## Tools Used

| Tool           | Purpose                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| `gunzip`       | Decompress `.gz` archive             |
| `tar`          | Extract `.tar` archive               |
| `file`         | Identify file types                  |
| `mount`        | Mount the disk image for inspection |
| `foremost`     | Carve deleted files from image      |
| `strings`      | Extract readable strings from binaries |
| `grep`         | Filter for specific patterns        |

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Decompress and Extract Archive

Decompress the archive:

```bash
gunzip ch39.gz
```
---


Rename and extract the tar archive:

```bash
mv ch39 ch39.tar
tar -xvf ch39.tar
```

---

### 2. Identify Disk Image
Check the file type of the extracted image:

```bash
file usb.image
```

Expected output:
```bash
usb.image: DOS/MBR boot sector, FAT32 filesystem
```

---

### 4. Recover Deleted Files Using Foremost
Carve deleted files from the disk image:

```bash
foremost -i usb.image -o output
```

Check carved PNG files:
```bash
ls output/png/
```
You should find:
```bash
00000168.png
```

---

### 5. Extract Hidden Data
Search for readable strings matching the flag format inside the PNG:

```bash
strings output/png/00000168.png | grep -E '[a-zA-Z]+[a-zA-Z]+'
```

This outputs:
```bash
<rdf:li>Javier Turcot</rdf:li>
```

The ownerâ€™s name is hidden as metadata inside the image.

ðŸ“Œ Summary
- This challenge involved decompressing a .gz archive.
- We extracted a USB image and used foremost to recover deleted files.
- Finally, we analyzed strings inside the .png to find hidden metadata.
